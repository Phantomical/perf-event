//! Intercepting perf-event system calls, for testing and logging.
//!
//! Note: this module is only available when the `"hooks"` feature is enabled.
//!
//! Many performance counters' behavior is inherently
//! non-deterministic, making it difficult to write tests for code
//! that uses the `perf_event` crate. There may be no way to reliably
//! provoke the Linux kernel into exhibiting the behavior you want to
//! test against. Or you may want to test functionality like
//! whole-system profiling, which requires elevated privileges that
//! one would prefer to avoid granting to tests.
//!
//! This module lets you interpose your own implementation of all the
//! system calls and ioctls that `perf_event` uses, granting you
//! complete control over `perf_event`'s interactions with the outside
//! world. You can verify that the system calls receive the parameters
//! you expect, and provide whatever sorts of interesting responses
//! you need.
//!
//! There are three main pieces:
//!
//! - The [`Hooks`] trait has a method for every system call and ioctl that the
//!   `perf_event` crate uses.
//!
//! - The [`set_thread_hooks`] function lets you provide a `Box<dyn Hooks>`
//!   trait object whose methods the calling thread will use for all subsequent
//!   `perf_event` operations.
//!
//! - The [`clear_thread_hooks`] function restores the thread's original state,
//!   so that subsequent `perf_event` operations use the real Linux system
//!   calls.
//!
//! This functionality is too low-level for direct use in tests, but
//! it does provide the means with which one can build more ergonomic
//! test harnesses.
//!
//! ## Stability
//!
//! Using `set_thread_hooks`, you can observe the exact sequence of
//! system operations that the `perf_event` crate performs to carry
//! out requests from the user. Even if the interface remains the
//! same, the implementation of those requests can change without
//! notice, possibly causing a [`Hooks`] implementation to see a
//! different set of calls.
//!
//! The `perf_event` crate will not treat such implementation changes
//! as breaking changes for semver purposes, despite the fact that
//! they may break code using this module's functionality.
