/// A hardware breakpoint.

/// parameters:
/// - the address that is being watched (`addr`)
/// - the number of bytes that breakpoint covers (`len`)
/// - which type of memory accesses we care about (`ty`)
///
/// Note that both number of bytes that can be watched as well as the number of
/// breakpoints that is allowed to be active at any given time is limited.
///
/// # Execute Breakpoint
/// We can use a breakpoint to count the number of times that a function gets
/// called, as long as the compiler does not optimize the function away.
///
/// ```
/// # use perf_event::Builder;
/// # use perf_event::events::Breakpoint;
/// #[inline(never)]
/// fn do_some_things() {
///     // ...
///     # println!("test println so the function doesn't get removed")
/// }
///
/// let fnptr = do_some_things as fn() as usize;
/// let mut counter = Builder::new(Breakpoint::execute(fnptr as u64)).build()?;
/// counter.enable()?;
///
/// for _ in 0..500 {
///     do_some_things();
/// }
///
/// counter.disable()?;
/// assert_eq!(counter.read()?, 500);
/// # std::io::Result::Ok(())
/// ```
///
/// # Data Breakpoint
/// We can also use a breakpoint to count the number of times that a memory
/// location is accessed.
/// ```
/// # use perf_event::Builder;
/// # use perf_event::events::Breakpoint;
/// #
/// let mut data: Vec<u64> = (0..1024).rev().collect();
///
/// let breakpoint = Breakpoint::read_write(&data[20] as *const _ as usize as u64, 8);
/// let mut counter = Builder::new(breakpoint).build()?;
/// counter.enable()?;
/// data.sort();
/// counter.disable()?;
///
/// println!("Position 20 accessed {} times", counter.read()?);
/// # std::io::Result::Ok(())
/// ```
///
/// # Usage Notes
/// - Some systems do not support creating read-only or write-only breakpoints.
///   If you are getting `EINVAL` errors while trying to build such a counter
///   using a read-write breakpoint might work instead.
///
/// - The valid values of len are quite limited. The [`perf_event_open`][man]
///   manpage indicates that the only valid values for `bp_len` are 1, 2, 4, and
///   8.
///
