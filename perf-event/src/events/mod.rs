//! Events we can monitor or count.
//!
//! There are a few general categories of event:
//!
//! - [`Hardware`] events are counted by the processor itself. This includes
//!   things like clock cycles, instructions retired, and cache and branch
//!   prediction statistics.
//!
//! - [`Cache`] events, also counted by the processor, offer a more detailed
//!   view of the processor's cache counters. You can select which level of the
//!   cache hierarchy to observe, discriminate between data and instruction
//!   caches, and so on.
//!
//! - [`Software`] events are counted by the kernel. This includes things like
//!   context switches, page faults, and so on.
//!
//! - [`Breakpoint`] events correspond to hardware breakpoints. They can count
//!   read/write accesses to an address as well as execution of an instruction
//!   address.
//!
//! Linux supports many more kinds of events than this module covers, including
//! events specific to particular make and model of processor, and events that
//! are dynamically registered by drivers and kernel modules. If something you
//! want is missing, think about the best API to expose it, and submit a pull
//! request!
